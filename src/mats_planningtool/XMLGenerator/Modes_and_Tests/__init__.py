""" This package consist of modules which contain functions that are called exclusively from the *XML_generator_select*. 
The name of each function is the same name as the corresponding Mode, Test, SeparateCMD in the *Science Mode Timeline.*\n

The functions are separated into modules depending on if they define a Mode, a Test (used during commisioning phase), or a separate CMD. 
Depending on their definition, the functions either call for Macros and/or CMDs from the *Macros_Commands* package.
