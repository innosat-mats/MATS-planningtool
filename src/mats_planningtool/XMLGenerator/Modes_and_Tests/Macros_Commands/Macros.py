"""Contain Macro functions, that calls for Command functions located in the *Commands* module.

Macros consists of frequently used combinations of Commands. Each macro (except the SetCCDs_macro) contain a 
*TC_acfLimbPointingAltitudeOffset* CMD, which will stagger the next CMD by a number of seconds equal to 
*Timeline_settings['pointing_stabilization']* when a new pointing altitude is set, or the previously set maximum TEXPMS when the pointing altitude is unchanged. 
This is important as the images need time to finish their current exposure before changing the CCD settings.
