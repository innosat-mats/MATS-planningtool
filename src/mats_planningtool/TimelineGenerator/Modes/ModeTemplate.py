Template for a new Science Mode where 'X' is exchanged for the number or name of the science mode. 
The Mode is here scheduled at the start of the timeline.

For *Timeline_gen* to be able to find and schedule this mode, this function must be imported in the *Modes_Header* module.
Remember to also add the name of this Science Mode into the *Scheduling_priority* function, in the *Configuration_File*.
