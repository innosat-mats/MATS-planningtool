"""Make sure to read the "Science Modes for MATS" document (at least Version 3.1). The programs (functions) that together constitute the Operational_Planning_Tool (OPT) are:
    
    - Copy_ConfigFile
    - Set_ConfigFile
    - CheckConfigFile
    - Timeline_gen
    - XML_gen
    - MinimalScienceXML_gen
    - Timeline_analyzer
    - Timeline_Plotter
    - Plot_Timeline_Plotter_Plots

**Abbreviations:**
    CMD = Command \n
    FOV = Field of View \n
    LP = Look point of the instrument. \n
    OPT = Operational Planning Tool \n
    SLOF = Spacecraft Local Orbit Frame, defined in "IS-OSE-IRD-0001_2B MATS Platform-Payload IRD". Yaw, pitch, and roll is defined as intrinsic Euler angles rotation (ZYZ) from Z-axis in SLOF to -Z axis in SBF. \n
    SBF = Spacecraft Body Frame, defined in "IS-OSE-IRD-0001_2B MATS Platform-Payload IRD". Optical axis is equal to -Z axis. \n
    
**Description:**
*Operational_Planning_Tool* uses a hiearchy structure with a procedural programming paradigm. Meaning that only the top level functions (the ones mentioned above) are supposed to be called by a user. \n

*Operational_Planning_Tool* uses a special .py file as a *Configuration File*, meaning that the settings inside the *Configuration File* dictate the operation of the program (unless the same settings are also present in the input of a function, see *XML_gen* and *Timeline_Plotter*). 
An example of a *Configuration_File* with default values is located in the Operational_Planning_Tool and is called *_ConfigFile.py*.  \n

Create your own *Configuration File* with an appropriate name by running *Copy_ConfigFile* with a chosen name as an input. 
*Copy_ConfigFile* makes a copy of *_ConfigFile.py*. The settings in your copy are modified manually in a text editor. \n

Your *Configuration File* must be chosen by running *Set_ConfigFile*. The TLE and start date to be used can either be manually edited directly in the *Configuration File* or they can be set with *Set_ConfigFile*. If a TLE or date has been set with *Set_ConfigFile*, the TLE and date in the *Configuration File* will be ignored. \n

The objective of *Operational_Planning_Tool* is to create a file consisting of planned Science Modes and Commands with timestamps (specified in "Science Modes for MATS" document). 
A *Science Mode Timeline*, as it is called, is created by running *Timeline_gen*. Remember to edit (in a text editor) and choose your *Configuration File* by running *Set_ConfigFile*. \n

The created *Science Mode Timeline* can be converted into a XML-file containing Payload and Platform Commands (formatted as specified in the "Innosat Payload Timeline XML Definition" document) 
by running *XML_gen* with the *Science Mode Timeline* as the input. The *_XMLGenerator* package also contains the definition of Science Modes and Macros on an operational level.

The *Science Mode Timeline* can also be simulated and plotted by running *Timeline_Plotter* with the *Science Mode Timeline* as the input. 
*Timeline_Plotter* can also optionally plot a special kind of .h5 data-files, created by OHB SWEDEN and defined in the "IS-OSE-OCD-0001 Ground Segment ICD" document. CSV files can also be plotted which can for example hold data created with STK. \n

**Note:** A *Science Mode Timeline* usually contains settings that are taken from the chosen *Configuration File* when the *Science Mode Timeline* was created. 
Any time a program/function uses a *Science Mode Timeline* as an input (*Timeline_Plotter* and *XML_gen*), these settings will be given priority over any shared settings stated in the currently chosen *Configuration File*. \n

*Check_ConfigFile* is used to check if the values stated in the chosen *Configuration File* are plausible. \n

All generated output files are saved in a folder called 'Output' in the working directory.
Generated logs are saved in folders created in the working directory.


Example:
    import OPT
    
    *#Create a new Configuration File named OPT_Config_File.#* \n
    OPT.Copy_ConfigFile('OPT_Config_File')
    
    *#Optionally change any settings in OPT_Config_File by using a text editor. For example change the TLE and start date used.#* \n
    
    *#Choose the newly created and edited Configuration File. #* \n
    OPT.Set_ConfigFile('OPT_Config_File')
    
    *#Sanity check for values in the chosen Configuration File. Also prints out the currently used start date and TLE.#* \n
    OPT.CheckConfigFile()
    
    *#Creates a Science Mode Timeline specified by settings given in the chosen Configuration File.#* \n
    OPT.Timeline_gen()
    
    *#Converts the created Science Mode Timeline into an XML-file. Settings stated in the Science Mode Timeline overrides settings in the Configuration File#* \n
    OPT.XML_gen('Output/Science_Mode_Timeline__OPT_Config_File.json')
    
    *#Plots the Science Mode Timeline, such as latitude, longitude, yaw, pitch, roll, RA and Dec of optical axis, altitude, altitude of LP and so on. Some plots generated are empty (reserved for optional inputs). #* \n
    Data_MATS, Data_LP, Time, Time_OHB  = OPT.Timeline_Plotter('Output/Science_Mode_Timeline__OPT_Config_File.json')
 
**Note:** \n

Science Modes are separated into 2 different areas, *Operational Science Modes* (Mode 1,2,5) and *Calibration Modes*. \n
*Calibration Modes* are scheduled at specific points of time and are mostly only scheduled once per *Science Mode Timeline*. 
*Operational Science Modes* (Mode 1,2,5) are scheduled whenever time is available (after the scheduling of *Calibration Modes*) and only one *Operational Science Mode* is scheduled per timeline.
The scheduling of certain *Calibration Modes* (science mode 120-124) depend on celestial object such as stars and the Moon. Therefore are the position of MATS and the pointing of the limb imager usually simulated to allow celestial object to be located in the FOV. \n

Ignore any message during import of OPT such as the one given here: "gzip was not found on your system! You should solve this issue for astroquery.eso to be at its best!
On POSIX system: make sure gzip is installed and in your path!On Windows: same for 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org)!". This can be ignored as the parts utilizing gzip/7zip are not used in OPT.
