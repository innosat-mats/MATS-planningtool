Config_File: Contains the name of the used *Configuration File* as set by *Set_ConfigFile*. By default it is set to 'OPT_Config_File'. \n

StartTime = Contains the starting time and date of OPT when set with *Set_ConfigFile*. If the value is None, the date specified directly in the *Configuration FIle* will be used. \n

TLE = Contains a TLE as a duple of strings when set by *Set_ConfigFile*. If the strings are empty, the TLE specified directly in the *Configuration File* will be used. \n

current_pointing = Only applicable to XML_generator. Contains the pointing altitude of the last scheduled *TC_acfLimbPointingAltitudeOffset* command.  \n

latestRelativeTime = Only applicable to XML_generator. The *relativeTime* of the latest scheduled CMD. Used to make sure that CMDs always are scheduled in a chronological order. \n

LargestSetTEXPMS = Only applicable to XML_generator. The latest largest set TEXPMS on the CCDs whenever CCD_macro is ran. This is the least amount of time that need to pass from going into idle mode and changing the CCD settings. \n

Mode120Iteration = Only applicable to Timeline_gen. Used to keep track of the current iteration of the scheduling process for Mode120. Used to cycle through the V_offsets chosen in the Configuration File. \n
